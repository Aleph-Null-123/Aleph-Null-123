-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arjun!

I'm currently a student at University of Washington's Transition School and will become a fully enrolled student at UW in Fall 2022. I am passionate about the computer science field and medical field, and I plan on developing my skills in both of these fields throughout my college journey. In the future, I see myself using and intertwining these skills to make contributions to the medical field.
